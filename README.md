# back-end
## List of modules and libraries being used:
- __Knex__ - SQL Query Builder for JavaScript
- __Knex-cleane__r - Helper library to clean a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database tables using Knex. Great for integration tests.
- __Helmet__ - helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers
- __Express__ - minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, as well as APIs. Can be thought of in the same vein as “React” but for the backend that way we use it. Will also allow our server to be able to read JSON.
- __CORS__ - node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS (Cross Origin Resource sharing) with various options
- __Sqlite3__ - relational database management system (RDBMS) that will let us interact with our .db3 files
- __Nodemon__ - is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected
- __Dotenv__ - is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a . env file into process. env . Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on the Twelve-Factor App methodology
 - __bcryptjs__ - used for password hashing/salting/accumulative hashing rounds
 - __Jsonwebtoken__ - add authentication when logging in to access protected routes
